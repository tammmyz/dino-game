	\section{Team Meeting Plan}
	Team Rex will primarily be using Facebook and Microsoft teams to communicate.
	All members must respond to posts or messages in which they have been mentioned within 24 hours. All members will meet on Microsoft teams every Monday and Wednesday between the hours of 9:30 am - 11:20 pm. If we are unable to complete the weekâ€™s tasks during lab time, the group will decide on an additional date during the week to complete said tasks.
	
	During these meetings, each individual will have a role (Administrator, Chair and Coordinator) as outlined in Table x. The roles will rotate every week.

	\section{Git Workflow Plan}

	A centralized workflow will be used where each team member will clone a copy of the project repository.
	This allows each developer to work independently from the changes made within the project. 
	To avoid conflicts, each developer must pull before pushing onto the repository. 
	There will be a master branch, which reflects the latest development changes. 
	In addition, we will have a develop branch where all the feature branches will be merged.
	Each new feature developed will have its own branch with its descriptive name.
	Some potential feature branches for this project can be for the sound effects, background, and settings. 
	Once the feature has finished development, it will be merged into the develop branch. 
	Before merging a branch into master or develop, the group must discuss and approve the changes made. 
	All approved changes must be merged back into master and tagged with a version number. 
	Throughout this project, there will be several merges between develop and master. 
	For instance, for every new theme developed for the game, there will be associated merges to master with a corresponding version number. Finally, milestones will be used as reference points for which deliverables should be done. These milestones will be included within the project Gantt chart.

	
	\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
	
	\section{Technology}
	The program will run on a computer that has Python and the library Pygame. 
	
	\section{Coding Style}
	This project will follow the PEP 8 style guide. The main objective of PEP is to enhance the consistency and readability of code. Using a standardized coding style amongst team members will keep the code cohesive and comprehendible as all variables, classes, and comments will be written in the same style.
