\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The current pandemic has abruptly disrupted the entertainment sector, and now people are seeking entertainment within the comfort of their homes. An example of an at-home entertainment solution is video games. We aim to provide home entertainment by redesigning the classic Chrome T-Rex dinosaur game. We plan to improve its user-friendliness and interactivity while maintaining the gameâ€™s basic functionality. The game's development will follow the software development process and be implemented in python using the PyGame library. The entire process will be documented and tested using the unit test framework. 
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients for this project are the course instructor of SFWRENG 3XA3, Dr. Ashgar Bokhari, and the teaching assistants (TAs), Stephanie Koehl, Veersah Palanichamy and Abdul Rab Mohammed. The clients will provide project requirements, deliverables and deadlines. They will also provide guidance when necessary and evaluate the project with respect to the requirements in the SRS document. 
\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are individuals who are interested in playing Chrome-Dino. The project does not explicitly target a demographic but is rather designed as a general-purpose entertainment source. The project is designed for anyone with the game's required software, such as Python and the PyGame library. 
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
All members of group 1 are stakeholders of this project. We are all responsible for the development process, such as implementing, testing, and documenting the project. Group 1 members all care for the project's success and are responsible for maintaining the repository. Developers that fork the repository and continue the project's development are also stakeholders as they will be continuing the project and are interested in the project's success



% Section 2: Project Constraints 
\section{Project Constraints}
are restrictions on the product due to the budget or the 
time available to build the product
    \subsection{Mandated Constraints}
    \subsubsection{Solution Design Constraints}
    Description: The game (an executable file) must be able to run on any machine running on Windows 7 or newer, macOS 10.12 
    Rationale: Most computer users already use systems with these specification and so the users will not need to purchase a new system.
    Fit criterion: The game will be developed into an executable file that will be made to run on Windows & or newer, macOS Sierra 10.12 or newer or Linux Ubuntu or newer4
\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
N/A
\subsubsection{Partner of a Collaborative Application}
N/A
\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
N/A
\subsubsection{Anticipated Workable Environment}
N/A
\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
Description: This project must follow the project schedule outlined in the Gantt chart and the Task Section.
Rationale: This is because, the project must be completed prior to the end of the course a strict pre-defined plan must be followed. This is also so to ensure that all deliverable are submitted by their due dates
Fit Criterion: All deliverable contained within this project must completed and submitted by April 12, 2022 

Due to the time constraints on this project(3 months), this project needs to follow a predefined plan in order to ensure it's completion in an organized manner.
