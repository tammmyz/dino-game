\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The current pandemic has abruptly disrupted the entertainment sector, and now people are seeking entertainment within the comfort of their homes. An example of an at-home entertainment solution is video games. We aim to provide home entertainment by redesigning the classic Chrome T-Rex dinosaur game. We plan to improve its user-friendliness and interactivity while maintaining the gameâ€™s basic functionality. The game's development will follow the software development process and be implemented in python using the Pygame library. The entire process will be documented and tested using the unit test framework. 
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients for this project are the course instructor of SFWRENG 3XA3, Dr. Ashgar Bokhari, and the teaching assistants (TAs), Stephanie Koehl, Veersah Palanichamy and Abdul Rab Mohammed. The clients will provide project requirements, deliverables and deadlines. They will also provide guidance when necessary and evaluate the project with respect to the requirements in the SRS document. 
\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are individuals who are interested in playing Chrome Dino Runner. The project does not explicitly target a demographic but is rather designed as a general-purpose entertainment source. The project is designed for anyone with the game's required software, which is Python and the Pygame library. 
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
All members of group one are the stakeholders of this project. We are all responsible for the development process, such as implementing, testing, and documenting the project. Group one members all care for the project's success and are responsible for maintaining the repository. Developers that fork the repository and continue the project's development are also stakeholders as they will be continuing the project and are interested in the project's success


% Section 2: Project Constraints 
\section{Project Constraints}
Project constraints are restrictions on the product due to the budget or the 
time available to build the product.
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

    \caption{A use case diagram that displays the functionality of the application.}
\end{figure}

The use case diagram above shows the different ways a user can interact with the system. The user can start a game and the game must include the current score, allow the user to jump over or duck under obstacles and at the end of gameplay display the final score. Game play is not impacted on whether a user goes to the main menu or if the score is saved to the database. Therefore, these action extend the use case. The use cases for viewing the instructions page, leaderboard page and settings menu are all self-explanatory.

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
There are currently no open issues in the Chrome Dino Runner repository.
However, the game developers recommended Pygame version 2.0.1 but we found that the current version 2.1.1 is also compatible with the game.
In addition, the code writes into a score.txt file that does not exist in the initial code repository. For this reason, we had to manually create and populate the score.txt file to successfully compile and run the game.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
A version of the game we are re-implementing is available on Chrome's offline mode and multiple websites including
https://chromedino.com/, https://dino-chrome.com/en and more.
Finally, during the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Google released
a limited edition themed version of the Dino game which is no longer available. 
\subsection{New Problems}
This new implementation of the game will not change the basic rules of the game.
Players who are accustomed to the original version of the game should be able to play the our version without
the need for instructions
\subsection{Tasks}

Tasks are scheduled and delegated as per the project
\label{subsec:Tasks}
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/maramotc/se3xa3/-/blob/main/GanttChart.pdf}{\color{blue}Gantt Chart}.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
An updated version of our product will include increased number of themes and additional features. The product will be designed with a focus on usability and entertainment. All of these new features and updates will be updated on the repository and issues/bugs will be fixed on a consistent basis. 

\subsection{Risks}
This project has minimal risk as it is designed for entertainment purposes. The significant risk of this project will be in terms of testing. The quality of our game will depend on the graphical user interface. Testing GUIâ€™s poses challenges as the only testing method available would be system testing. Compared to unit testing, system testing increases the change of bugs and issues going undiscovered. Our game must also be compatible with different hardware configurations and on multiple operating systems.
\subsection{Costs}
This project does not have any costs associated with it as it is being developed with open-source software and resources. The only cost is time resources; these resources will be used for the development, documentation and testing of the project. 
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{Documentation}
An instructions page will be available in the main menu of the game.
This page will contain instructions on how the game is to be played as well as the keys that can be used as controls. Information regarding scoring will also be present in this page.
Finally, the main repository of the game will include a README file, which will detail the installation and set-up instructions.
\subsubsection{Training}
A user can play the \textbf{Chrome Dino Runner} with no necessary training. The game's controls (WASD and arrows) should be intuitive when jumping over obstacles. The player may practice the game to improve skill, but no prior training is needed to succeed.  
\subsection{Waiting Room}
% ## do we just put our improvements here?? I think so - SF
\begin{itemize}
 \item Adding background music to the game to match the speed of the dinosaur
 \item Developing a themed version of the game 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item For example: McMaster student theme, Covid-19 theme
 \end{itemize}
 \item Inserting a play again button
 \item Creating additional pages such as a home, leaderboard and  instruction page 
 \item Implementing new button control and keyboard binding such as A,W,S,D keys
 \item Changing module design and incorporating software engineering principles
\end{itemize}
